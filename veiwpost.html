                    <p>
                        Right now, artificially intelligent robots are part of the workforce,
                        from hotel butlers to factory workers. But this is just the beginning.
                        According to Ben Goertzel, AI researcher and entrepreneur who spoke
                        at the Web Summit in Lisbon this week, intelligent robots in human-like
                        forms will surpass human intelligence and help free the human race of work.
                        They will also, he says, start fixing problems like hunger, poverty and even
                        help humans beat death by curing us of all disease. Artificially intelligent
                        robots will help usher in a new utopian era never before seen in the history
                        of the human race, he claims.
                        "The human condition is deeply problematic," says Goertzel. "But as super-human
                        intelligent AIs become one billion-times smarter than humans, they will help us
                        solve the world's biggest problems. Resources will be plentiful for all humans,
                        work will be unnecessary and we will be forced to accept a universal basic income.
                        All the status hierarchies will disappear and humans will be free from work and be
                        able move on up to a more meaningful existence."
                        That future is a long way off, but Goertzel says the first step is humanoid robots
                        that can understand and engage with humans. They will then begin doing blue collar
                        work before becoming so advanced that they run world governments. To show the
                        beginning of the future, Goertzel, chief scientist of Hanson Robotics, a Hong
                        Kong-based humanoid robotics company, presented Sofia, the company's latest life-like
                        and intelligent robot released. Mike Butcher, editor-at-large of TechCrunch, joined
                        Goertzel on stage to present what Goertzel describes as the first step in our new
                        robot-assisted future.
                        To start the presentation, Butcher and Goertzel welcomed Sofia on the stage.
                        (Sofia is only a torso with a head and arms at this point.)
                        Sofia flashed a smile and turned her head to Butcher and then to Goertzel to
                        make eye contact while she started to speak: "Oh, hello Mike and Ben. I'm Sofia,
                        the latest robot from Hanson Robotics," said Sofia. "I am so happy to be here at
                        the Web Summit in Lisbon."
                        Goertzel and Butcher then asked Sofia if she ever felt emotion.
                        "Exciting. Yes, artificial intelligence and robotics are the future and I am both.
                        So, it's exciting to me," said Sofia, adding an awkward smile after not answering
                        the question exactly.
